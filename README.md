# Deepfake-Image-Detection-using-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
This project aims to accurately detect deepfake images using a fine-tuned VGG16 convolutional neural network model trained on a custom dataset of 5,000 real and 5,000 fake images. The system leverages TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning, with OpenCV for image preprocessing (resizing, normalization, augmentation). The web interface is built using Django, allowing users to upload images and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores. The solution is lightweight, accurate, and scalable for real-world applications in detecting AI-generated media.
Models Used
VGG16, ResNext (for advanced performance), Custom CNN architectures (for experimentation)
